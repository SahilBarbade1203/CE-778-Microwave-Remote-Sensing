# Tutorial 1
This repository contains a tutorial exercise for setting up Python using the Anaconda distribution, installing necessary packages like GDAL, and working with ALOS PALSAR satellite data from the Alaska Satellite Facility. The exercise includes downloading a Level 1.1 image of a selected location, calculating the total number of pixels, identifying the path number, flight direction, absolute orbit, and polarization, and extracting the real and imaginary components of HH and HV polarizations using Python. The workflow is designed to familiarize users with handling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and preparing for further analysis, such as creating intensity and phase image visualizations.
